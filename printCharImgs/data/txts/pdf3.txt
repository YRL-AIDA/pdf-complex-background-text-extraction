Box 16, H-7401 Kaposvár, Hungary; e-mail: lanszki@mail.atk.u-kaposvar.huReceived 11 October 2004; Accepted 23 May 2005Abstract. The diet of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) cubs living in a moor in Hungary was studied by scat analysis (n = 77) during the rearing period. The main food source of foxes consisted of small mammals (preferred Microtus voles) which was supplemented with brown hare and gamebirds rarely. Cubs ate remains of carrions (domestic animals, ungulates and carnivores) and invertebrates frequently but in low quantity. The food consisted of characteristically terrestrial. occasionally aquatic and rarely arboreal prey.Key words: Vulpes vulpes, cubs, Microtus preference, HungaryIntroductionRed fox Vulpes vulpes (L.) is a generalist predator, widely spread and common species in Europe (Llo yd 1980). In Hungary, the red fox population has increased in recent years (in 1988: 4.9 ind. /1000 ha, in 2001: 12.8 ind. /1000 ha, Heltai 2002). The diet in spring and summer is primarily composed of small mammals, and in addition to these, also birds, hare, fruits and carrion are important e.g. on meadows, woods and agricultural landscapes in central Europe (Suchentrunk 1984, Goszczynski 1986, Kožená 1988, Jedrzeje wska & Jedrzejewski 1998). Compared to other habitats, the feeding habits of fox in the shrinking moor areas (L e c k ie et al. 1998), especially in the Pannonian region are less known. Moreover, the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the food that the vixen supply the cubs with (Kolb & He wson 1980, Lloyd 1980) are also described to a lesser extent. The aim of this case study was to investigate the diet and feeding habits of red fox living in a moor during the cubs' dependency stage.Material and MethodsThe study area, named Nagybereki Fehérvíz Moor Nature Conservation Area is situated in western Hungary (46°38' N, 17°32' E, 99m a.s.l.). The typical vegetations of this area are mire willow scrubs (Salicetum spp.), large sedge communities (Carex spp.) and alder swamp wood (Cariceti elongatae-Alnetum). A rich fen is located on the area, which is periodically used as cow pasture.The diet of the red fox were studied by scat analysis. Samples (n = 77) were collected between 14 April 2002 to 18 July 2002 around a fox den. Prey determination was performed by microscope on the basis of feather, bone, dentition and hair characteristics (more detail: L an s zki 2003). Diet composition was expressed as the relative frequency of occurrence and as an estimate of the percentage fresh weight (biomass) of food consumed (Jedrzejewska & Jedrzeje wski 1998).
